Players for TheMovieDb-Helper that support active Matrix/Nexus Add-ons (updated as of Sept 15 2023) 
If any are broken, or not listed please let me know. I will look at it and let you know what I can or can't do. 
I can usually create a player for add-ons built as forks of either Exodus, Shadow, Fen or Venom.
