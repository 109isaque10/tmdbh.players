Players for TheMovieDb-Helper that support ACTIVE Kodi 19/20 Add-ons (updated as of Sept 15 2023) 
If any are broken, or not listed please let me know. I will look at it and let you know what I can or can't do. 
I can usually create a player for add-ons built as forks of either Exodus, Shadow, Fen or Venom.

Enter URL into TheMovieDb-Helper settings for players: https://bit.ly/gplayers

Please Note: If you are updating a broken player that you reconfigured in any way, you must go back into the Helper settings and reset that player to defaults. Otherwise the Helper will continue to read the broken reconfigured player instead of the newer updated version.  

I have not tested Players in Kodi 21 Omega yet.
